      "description": "Today, more than ever, there is a enewed focus and awareness on health and fitness. People are truly beginning to understand how exercise not only helps your body, but your mind too. As a result, people are looking for more information on their journey to good health. But how do you find the right place to get quality information on health and fitness? There are a lot of blogs out there, and not all of them provide  the best or most reliable information.\n\nIn this digital age, there’s no better place than the internet for finding the answers you need. Fitness apps, videos, and influencers can be a great source of information, but there’s one resource which can be a massive help: fitness blogs. If you’re a fitness business owner, you can learn a thing or two from the way some of the best fitness blogs package their content and engage with the reader. In this article, we’ll take a look at some key blogging statistics, what makes a successful fitness blog, and 12 fitness blogs you need to follow right now.\n\nIn private coaching, we focus on your specific goals, dive deep into your unique story, and tailor our sessions to whatever it is you want and need.\n\n I’ve been a highly sensitive, empathic, and creative person from a very young age, and was always writing poetry, painting, singing, and dancing. But by eighteen, my world became flat with depression. I viewed nature as nothing more than decoration, and I lost contact with myself and my body, which made it impossible to utilize my creativity fully and with an open heart.\n\nAt twenty-two, I was living a seemingly  normal  life: I worked at a job I didn't like, I was friends with people I couldn’t be myself with, and I dated people I didn’t feel connected to. But somewhere inside there was a voice (one that spoke to me in feelings rather than words) saying over and over that there was another way. That there was another way to live, to love, and to express myself. That there was something more to life than what I’d been conditioned to think.To be fair, they’re often not consciously aware of how much fear they carry, or how that fear impacts them day-to-day. After all, they know (and love) plenty of wonderful and trustworthy men who would never threaten or hurt a woman, and they recognize how unfair it would be to let a few “bad apples” spoil the bunch, as it were.\n\nTo sum up, a diet rich in diversity (aiming for 30 plant points a week) has been shown to help boost and support your mental health, as well as bring a whole host of other benefits! So let's take a look at how we can include the magic of the Med in our diet.\n\nThe truth is, when it comes to bloating, there is no silver bullet. It would be great to find the one supplement/tea/food to eliminate, which also functions as a cure-all. However, the reality is that the causes of bloating are often complex. But the good news is that there are a series of simple diet and lifestyle changes backed by science that can put an end to the suffering.",

      "description": "I’m writer, speaker, and coach on a mission to help folks escape the suffering caused by body image issues, through the pursuit of body neutrality.\n\n With the rise of mainstream body positivity, I thought we had finally found a cure for body hatred, insecurity, anxiety, obsession, and dysmorphia! Suffering from body image issues myself, I was beyond excited. But here we are over a decade later, and body image issues are more widespread and dangerous than ever.\n\nThrough my own personal journey, and thousands of hours coaching others, I've discovered that trying to  love your body  is not only unrealistic or even impossible for most of us, but it actually tends to make us feel even worse about ourselves, too.That's why I guide my clients to body neutrality instead.\n\nThrough private and group coaching over Zoom and Voxer, I help folks from all over the world to feel the way they previously thought could only be felt by achieving a certain kind of body: confident, secure, safe, empowered, connected, happy, and worthy.\n\nWhen not coaching, writing, or creating content, you can find me napping, riding my OneWheel, enjoying the golden age of television, or snuggling with my cat Walden.\n\nMy job is to help you identify your underlying root cause for body image suffering, and then take away its reason for existing, using a method I've created called the Body Neutrality Blueprint.My struggle with body acceptance started in middle school, when I compared myself to a popular girl and realized for the first time that I didn’t look anything like her. My cheeks were rounder and bigger, my chin was less defined, and my ears stuck out.\n\n From then on, I compared myself to others constantly: my face, my body, even my behavior. And it always seemed to me that they were better; that they were “good enough,” and I was not.\n\nAs a society, nobody really teaches us to celebrate our uniqueness, and in fact it’s often legitimately unsafe for us to be our true selves. Depending on where you grow up, the punishment for authentic self-expression can be anything from chronic shame to violence or execution. So most of us never felt safe enough to try, and never had the chance to bloom into ourselves. Most of us were never encouraged to hold our differences with reverence and awe, instead of comparison and judgment.\n\nA healthy diet can encourage the growth of the hippocampus, which is involved in regulating emotions and memory. This was illustrated in an 11-year study published in 2018. Participants who had a typical Western diet (high in processed food and red meat) had a smaller hippocampus on average than those who had a healthier, plant-rich diet.",

      "description": "Today, more than ever, there is a renewed focus and awareness on health and fitness. People are truly beginning to understand how exercise not only helps your body, but your mind too. As a result, people are looking for more information on their journey to good health. But how do you find the right place to get quality information on health and fitness? There are a lot of blogs out there, and not all of them provide the best or most reliable information.\n\nIn this digital age, there’s no better place than the internet for finding the answers you need. Fitness apps, videos, and influencers can be a great source of information, but there’s one resource which can be a massive help: fitness blogs. If you’re a fitness business owner, you can learn a thing or two from the way some of the best fitness blogs package their content and engage with the reader. In this article, we’ll take a look at some key blogging statistics, what makes a successful fitness blog, and 12 fitness blogs you need to follow right now.\n\nIn private coaching, we focus on your specific goals, dive deep into your unique story, and tailor our sessions to whatever it is you want and need.\n\nI’ve been a highly sensitive, empathic, and creative person from a very young age, and was always writing poetry, painting, singing, and dancing. But by eighteen, my world became flat with depression. I viewed nature as nothing more than decoration, and I lost contact with myself and my body, which made it impossible to utilize my creativity fully and with an open heart.\n\nAt twenty-two, I was living a seemingly  normal  life: I worked at a job I didn't like, I was friends with people I couldn’t be myself with, and I dated people I didn’t feel connected to. But somewhere inside there was a voice (one that spoke to me in feelings rather than words) saying over and over that there was another way. That there was another way to live, to love, and to express myself. That there was something more to life than what I’d been conditioned to think.To be fair, they’re often not consciously aware of how much fear they carry, or how that fear impacts them day-to-day. After all, they know (and love) plenty of wonderful and trustworthy men who would never threaten or hurt a woman, and they recognize how unfair it would be to let a few “bad apples” spoil the bunch, as it were.\n\nTo sum up, a diet rich in diversity (aiming for 30 plant points a week) has been shown to help boost and support your mental health, as well as bring a whole host of other benefits! So let's take a look at how we can include the magic of the Med in our diet.\n\nThe truth is, when it comes to bloating, there is no silver bullet. It would be great to find the one  supplement/tea/food to eliminate, which also functions as a cure-all. However, the reality is that the causes of bloating are often complex. But the good news is that there are a series of simple diet and lifestyle changes backed by science that can put an end to the suffering.",

      "description": "Whether I’m exploring my local area or I’m away on a trip, I’ve often spot Crunch Fitness gyms in the wild. And with over 400 locations in the U.S., many recognize the logos and have peered through he club’s glass windows.\n\nThat’s why Crunch Fitness’ website falls more in line with what you might expect an enterprise site to look like. However, there are still some features that help it to stand out. For example, take its emphasis on customer-centricity. The homepage lists the gym’s four “crunchisms” that highlight a commitment to positivity, inclusion, and crushing goals.\n\nAlso notable is the site’s navigation. Despite its array of offerings and locations, the website carefully structures its pages to guide visitors exactly to where they want, whether it’s a membership, personal or group training, or classes.What we like: Crunch Fitness prominently features free trial options. If you offer a similar opportunity, make sure people can learn about trials on your site.\n\nThough you could call it a simple WordPress-WooCommerce site, the design shows an appreciation for space and attention to detail that visitors will expect and enjoy.\n\nSeveral pages on this website begin with full-width videos that lull users into the site’s experience. Then, the inviting copy helps us get to know Juliet, her mission, and where we can sign up to learn more. Those looking for more value can read the blog containing dozens of articles centered on wellness and mindfulness.\n\nLike the bent-over row, the chest-supported row involves multiple upper-back muscles — primarily the latissimus dorsi (lats), trapezius (traps), and rhomboids. Your lats, which are the largest back muscles, are the main mover during any row variation. Meanwhile, your traps help stabilize your scapula, and the rhomboids play an important role in shoulder stabilization.\n\n“I keep coming back to the Sweat Challenge because it gives me an opportunity to renew my goals, refocus and a sense of excitement to see the kind of progress I can make in 42 days, says Gloria, a busy mum of two and business owner. Sweat Challenges are a reminder for me that I am important, too!”\n\nDuring the Sweat Challenge, you could follow your favourite trainers on Instagram for updates, exercise demos and all sorts of motivational talks and tips to help you feel motivated, informed and ready to achieve your goals. For Kayla and Kelsey, this challenge held plenty of significance as it was an opportunity to bring a whole new fitness experience.\n\n This Sweat Challenge was so important to me because it was my Bootcamp Challenge!  Kayla says, reminiscing on some amazing memories.I used to run bootcamps all over the world and have thousands and thousands of girls there working out and if you couldn’t do the bootcamp we would record it so you could do it at home.\n\n Prioritising your MENTAL and emotional health is always at the forefront of my fitness messaging and mission,  Kelsey shared when her program was announced. Each week, she taught one of her favourite mindfulness practices to complete alongside the strength workouts.\n\nWhether you’ve tried a new training style, started a new habit or discovered motivation you didn’t know you had, your achievements are amplified when you share them with women going through a similar journey!",
